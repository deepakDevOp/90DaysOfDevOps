What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?

The #!/bin/bash at the beginning of a shell script is called a shebang or hashbang.
It specifies the path to the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.
In this case, #!/bin/bash indicates that the script should be interpreted using the
Bash shell.
We can use #!/bin/sh as well. It instructs to use the system's default Bourne shell.
